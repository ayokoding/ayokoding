- Chapter 1 - Learning the Foundations for GitHub Actions
	- A brief trip through the history of software development
		- [[Waterfall Model (SDLC)]]
			- Software development started as a slow, cautious, and methodical practice that followed a sequence of steps aimed at delivering perfect products.
			- Predominant between 1960s and 1980s.
			- The Waterfall model is known for its inflexible, process-oriented, and sequential nature.
			- Extensive and time-consuming planning and approvals
		- [[Extreme Programming (XP)]]
			- Reinforced the concept that tests should be written to describe how code should work, which was also the center of [[Test-Driven Development (TDD)]] practices.
			- The early 1990s
			- [[The Agile Manifesto]]
				- The [[Agile Aliance]] was formed
	- [[Continuous Integration (CI)]]
		- Automated processes should be in place to test and build software many times a day.
			- Important because bugs are commonly introduced at the intersection or integration of two different pieces of code
	- [[Continuous Delivery (CD)]]
		- CD follows in the footsteps of CI.
		- It focuses on gathering all changes to code—such as new features, bug fixes, and configuration changes—and sending them to users—or production—as safely, sustainably, and quickly as possible.

- Chapter 2 - Deep Diving into [[GitHub Actions]]
	- Learning about GitHub Actions' core concepts and components
		- Events
			- GitHub Actions are event-driven.
			- Workflows can be triggered by 3 groups of events
				- Scheduled events
					- Trigger a workflow run at a specified time.
					- They use [[POSIX cron syntax]]
					- Scheduled events run on the latest commit on the default branch.
					- Example:
						- Trigger every 5 minutes (the shortest interval we can schedule intervals for)
							- ```yaml
							  on:
							    schedule:
							      - cron:  '*/5 * * * *'
							  ```
				- Manual events
					- 2 types of manual events
						- `workflow_dispatch`
							- Used to trigger specific workflows within the repository on GitHub manually.
							- It also allows us to define custom input properties, as well as default and required inputs.
							- To trigger the `workflow_dispatch` event, the workflow must be on the default branch.
							- Example
								- ```yaml
								  on:
								    workflow_dispatch:
								      inputs:
								        username:
								          description: 'Your GitHub username'
								          required: true
								        reason:
								          description: 'Why are you running this workflow manually?'
								          required: true
								          default: 'I am running tests before implementing an automated workflow'
								  ```
						- `repository_dispatch`
							- The workflow can happen in different repositories or in environment outside GitHub.
							- To trigger this event, we must use the GitHub API and send a POST request that provides an `event_type` name that we will describe the activity type.
								- Example
									- ```sh
									  curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/dispatches -d '{"event_type":"event_type"}'
									  ```
							- We will need to use the [[Personal Access Token (PAT)]].
				- Webhook events
					- Trigger a workflow when GitHub webhook events - such as issue and pull request creation, update, and deletion, deployment, page_build, and others - are created.
			- Jobs
				- A set of steps that run on the same runner.
				- Multiple jobs within the same workflow can run sequentially, although by default, they will run in parallel.
				- Example
					- ```yaml
					  jobs:
					    tests_manual_workflow:
					      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
					  ```
			- Steps
				- Individual tasks that can run commands.
				- Steps can share data among themselves because is step in a given job runs on the same runner.
				- Example
					- ```yaml
					  steps:
					      - run: >
					            echo "User ${{ github.event.inputs.username }} ran a workflow manually."
					            echo "Because ${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}."
					  ```
			- Actions
				- Standalone commands that can be portable.
				- Combined into steps to create a job.
				- Example
					- ```yaml
					  jobs:
					    stale:
					      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
					      steps:
					      - uses: actions/stale@v3
					  ```
			- Runners
				- A runner is a server application, often installed on a virtual machine or Docker container, that runs a job from a GitHub Actions workflow.
				- In general, a runner runs one job at a time and reports its progress to GitHub.
				- While each job in a workflow executes on a fresh instance of the virtual machine, all the steps in a job execute in the same instance of the virtual machine. This allows the actions within that job to share information using the filesystem.
				- Two types of runners
					- GitHub-hosted runners
						- Available: Windows, Mac, Ubuntu
						- GitHub provides specific, case-sensitive environment variables that we should use to access the file system, rather than using hardcoded paths.
							- home
								- `HOME`
							- workspace
								- `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`
							- workflow
								- `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`
						- Each VM, independently of the OS, has the same hardware resources: a 2-core CPU, 7 GB of RAM, 14 GB of SSD disk space.
					- Self-hosted runners
	- Understanding the basics of workflows
		- Workflow configuration is defined in a workflow file, which must be written using YAML.
		- All workflow files related to GitHub Actions must live in the `.github/workflows` directory and must have either the `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension.
		- Learning the basics of the workflow file syntax
			- `name`
				- Optional
			- `on`
				- Required
				- Which event or events will trigger the workflow.
			- `jobs`
				- Workflow runs can have one or more jobs.
				- Example
					- ```yaml
					  jobs:
					    jobA:
					    jobB:
					      needs: jobA
					    jobC:
					      needs: [jobA, jobB]
					  ```
				- `job_id`
					- Each job must have a `job_id` associated with it.
					- Must be strings that contain only alphanumeric characters.
					- Must start with either an `_` or letter and must be unique to that specific job.
				- `needs`
					- Optional
					- Requirements before running job
				- `runs_on`
					- Required
					- Example
						- ```yaml
						  runs-on:
						  	self-hosted
						  ```
				- `steps`
					- Tasks that exist within a job.
					- Example
						- ```yaml
						  steps:
						      - run: >
						            echo "User ${{ github.event.inputs.username }} ran a workflow manually."
						            echo "Because ${{ github.event.inputs.reason }}."
						  ```
				- `uses`
					- Use an existing action.
