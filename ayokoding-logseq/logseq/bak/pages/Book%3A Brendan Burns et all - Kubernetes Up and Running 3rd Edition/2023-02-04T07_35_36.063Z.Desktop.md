- Chapter 1 - Introduction
	- Outlines the high-level benefits of Kubernetes without diving too deeply into the details.
	- Containers and Kubernetes can provide the tools that we need to move quickly while staying available. The core concepts that enable this are:
		- Immutability
		- Declarative configuration
			- Defines state
			- The idea of storing declarative configuration in source control is often referred to as [[Infrastructure as Code]]
				- When we adopt [[GitOps]], changes to production are made entirely via pushes to a Git repository, which are then reflected into our cluster via automation.
		- Online self-healing systems
			- It continuously takes actions to ensure that the current state matches the desired state.
		- Shared reusable libraries and tools
	- Scaling your service and your teams
		- Decoupling
			- In a decoupled architecture, each component is separated from other components by defined APIs and service load balancers.
		- Easy scaling for applications and clusters.
			- Immutability makes scaling trivial to implement.
		- Scaling development teams with microservices
			- Ideal team size is the "[[two-pizza team]]" or roughly six to eight people
			- Kubernetes provides numerous abstractions and APIs that make it easier to build these decoupled microservice architectures.
				- Pods
					- single deployable unit
				- Services
					- Provide load balancing, naming, and discovery
				- Namespaces
					- Provide isolation and access control
				- Ingress objects
					- Provide an easy-to-use front end that can combine multiple microservices into a single externalized API surface area.
		- Separation of concerns for consistency and scaling
	- Abstracting your infrastructure
		- The move to application-oriented container APIs like Kubernetes has two concrete benefits.
			- It separates developers from specific machines
				- Machines can simply be added in aggregate to scale the cluster
			- Enables a high degree of portability
				- Developers are consuming a higher-level API that is implemented in terms of the specific cloud infrastructure APIs.
	- Efficiency
		- Because developers no longer think in terms of machines, their applications can be colocated on the same machines without impacting the applications themselves.
