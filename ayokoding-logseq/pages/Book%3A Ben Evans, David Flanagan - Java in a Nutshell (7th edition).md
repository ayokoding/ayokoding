		- Life-cycle of a Java program.
	- Chapter 2 - Java Syntax from the Ground Up
		- Details of the Java programming language, including the Java 8 language changes.
	- Chapter 3 - Object-Oriented Programming in Java
		- Describes how the basic Java syntax in the previous chapter is used to write simple OO programs using classes and objects.
		- This chapter assumes no prior experience with object-oriented programming.
	- Chapter 4 - The Java Type System
		- Introduces the other aspects of Java's type system, such as generic types, enumerated types, and annotations.
		- Lambda expressions.
	- Chapter 5 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Design in Java
		- Overview of some basic techniques used in the design of sound object-oriented programs, and briefly touches on the topic of design patterns and their use in software engineering.
	- Chapter 6 - Java's Approach to Memory and Concurrency
		- How the [[Java Virtual Machine (JVM)]] manages memory on behalf of the programmer, and how memory and visibility are intimately entwined with Java's support for concurrent programming and threads.
	- Chapter 7 - Programming and Documentation Conventions
		- Documents important and widely adopted Java programming conventions. It also explains how we can make our Java code self-documenting by including specially formatted documentation comments.
