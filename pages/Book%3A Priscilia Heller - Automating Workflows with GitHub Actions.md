- Chapter 1 - Learning the Foundations for GitHub Actions
  - A brief trip through the history of software development
    - [[Waterfall Model (SDLC)]]
      - Software development started as a slow, cautious, and methodical practice that followed a sequence of steps aimed at delivering perfect products.
      - Predominant between 1960s and 1980s.
      - The Waterfall model is known for its inflexible, process-oriented, and sequential nature.
      - Extensive and time-consuming planning and approvals
    - [[Extreme Programming (XP)]]
      - Reinforced the concept that tests should be written to describe how code should work, which was also the center of [[Test-Driven Development (TDD)]] practices.
      - The early 1990s
      - [[The Agile Manifesto]]
        - The [[Agile Aliance]] was formed
  - [[Continuous Integration (CI)]]
    - Automated processes should be in place to test and build software many times a day.
      - Important because bugs are commonly introduced at the intersection or integration of two different pieces of code
  - [[Continuous Delivery (CD)]]
    - CD follows in the footsteps of CI.
    - It focuses on gathering all changes to code—such as new features, bug fixes, and configuration changes—and sending them to users—or production—as safely, sustainably, and quickly as possible.
